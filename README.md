# ringfft

**ringfft** is a lightweight, flexible Python library designed for researchers, students, and practitioners in lattice-based cryptography, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and code-based cryptography. It provides easy-to-use, modular implementations of FFT and Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) algorithms based on ring isomorphisms, with intuitive visualization tools.
